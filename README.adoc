= Ribose Open Source Software Guidelines

This guide reflects our current development practices we have adopted
for all of our open source projects. This is the
https://github.com/riboseinc/guides[Ribose fork] of the
https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides[thoughtbot guide].
It is mostly similar with some minor adjustments.

If you are contributing to any of our open source projects then it's
highly expected that you follow this guidelines, but if you have some
different opinion about any of the rules then please open
https://github.com/riboseinc/oss-ruby-contribution-guide/issues[an Issue] for
detailed discussion.

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

== Ruby Projects

For Ruby-based projects, we use

which is based on the
https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide[bbatsov-guide]

Once you start a new project, please add the following files to it to
automate checks in every Pull Request.

* link:style/.rubocop.yml[rubocop config]
* link:style/.hound.yml[Hound CI config]

Once everything is setup,
https://houndci.com[Hound CI]
should comment on each of the Pull Requests whenever there is a
violations, and please do not merge it until you resolve those.
